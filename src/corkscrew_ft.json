        "Cannulated and vented: Anchor design minimizes anchor material and allows blood and bone marrow to flow through the anchor",
        "SutureTape version: Differentiate from competitor knot tying systems with SutureTape benefits which are stronger knotless and knotted fixation - higher resistance to tissue pullthrough and better handling characteristics",
        "Internal suture loop: Allows cortical engagement of screw thread, no need to countersink anchor",
        "Internal suture loop: No need for eyelet orientation, self-oriented",
        "Internal suture loop: Removes risk of suture cheese wire through bio and BioComposite material",
        "Internal suture loop: Allows for a smooth suture on suture slide",
        "High fixation strength: 350-400N",
        "Sell the suture eyelet benefits alongside SutureTape-BioComposite and vented anchor body to secure business"
